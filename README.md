# Spring Rest Security Boilerplate

In this project, We, [Ugurcan Lacin](https://github.com/ugurcanlacin) and [Volkan Dogan](https://github.com/volkandgn), are going to build a boilerplate by applying most common Java framework which is Spring. 

We will build Rest APIs by helping of Spring Security and Spring Boot. Every configuration will be Java based Annotations instead XML.

We will try to cover all security problems and their solutions as much as we can do.
